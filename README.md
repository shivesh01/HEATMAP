INTRODUCTION 

In this workshop you will use python language and its libraries to create stunning heatmap from scratch. Even if you don't know the python language no worries this tutorial  will guide you and keep you intrested. Most importantly you will learn about  heatmap. what is heatmap? and how tp make one like data scientist do!ðŸ¤—.
Even you can visualize the data, your own data too!


I m showing you what you will learned after completing  the workshop

[Click Here to Working DEMO on Repl](https://repl.it/@ShiveshSingh/Heatmap#main.py)


Getting started

You just need to setup an account on repl.
Or You can run this program on your Python idle like pycharm, atom, Jupyter notebook and visual studio e.t.c

Step zero!


Importing libraries 

repl - when we programming  in repl it automatically imports the libraries and dependencies  with simple command shown below .
and hit run.
we have used pd as initial  because  we don't have to write whole panda again and again...

``` import pandas as pd ```
        
YAy! you have completed the first step by importing panda library

 for repl ...  images
 
 for terminal based like pycharm, jupyter, atom and visual studio ...
 
 You have to go to command line

Know more about the libraries you will use

-panda
pandas (all lowercase) is a popular Python-based data analysis toolkit which can be imported using import pandas as pd. It presents a diverse range of utilities, ranging from parsing multiple file formats to converting an entire data table into a NumPy matrix array. This makes pandas a trusted ally in data science and machine learning.

-numpy
NumPy is a library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
Basically it is used to perform large set of mathematical operations on array. array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.

-scipy
SciPy is an open-source Python library which is used to solve scientific and mathematical problems. It is built on the NumPy extension and allows the user to manipulate and visualize data with a wide range of high-level commands.

-Statsmodel
Statsmodels is a Python package that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests. An extensive list of descriptive statistics, statistical tests, plotting functions, and result statistics are available for different types of data and each estimator.

-Matplotlib
A picture is worth a thousand words, and with Pythonâ€™s matplotlib library, it fortunately takes far less than a thousand words of code to create a production-quality graphic.

-Seaborn
 Seaborn library is one of the rarest earth metal. If you are science student you will get...ðŸ˜„. Let's talk about seaborn library which is made up in top of the
 Matplotlib  library. Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on.

Seaborn: Seaborn, on the other hand, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes.G
 Great Right!ðŸ˜²
