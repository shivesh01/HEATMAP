# INTRODUCTION 

In this workshop, you will be using python language and its libraries to create a stunning heatmap from scratch. Even if you don't know the python language no worries this tutorial will guide you and keep you interested. Most importantly you will learn about heatmap. let's talk about what is a heatmap? and how to make one like data scientists do!ü§ó.
A heat map (or heatmap) is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by color. Heat maps make it easy to visualize complex data and understand it at a glance:
Even you can visualize the data, your own data too!

# You have done a fantastic work by completing step zero!üëè

**Advantage of working on repl**

*when we program in repl it automatically imports the libraries and dependencies with the simple command. So, You just need a replt account or any python idle to get started*
     
# Know more about the libraries you will going to use:

## Pandasüêº
Pandas is a popular Python-based toolkit. It presents a diverse range of utilities like converting an entire data table into a NumPy matrix array and much more. This makes pandas a trusted ally in data science and machine learning.

## Numpyüî¢
NumPy is a library used for working with arrays. Basically, it is used to perform a large set of mathematical operations on an array. An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.

## Scipyüë®üèª‚Äçüî¨
SciPy is an open-source Python library that is used to solve scientific and mathematical problems. It is built on the NumPy extension and allows the user to manipulate and visualize data with a wide range of high-level commands.

## StatsmodelüßÆ
Statsmodels is a Python package that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.

## Matplotlibüìä
A picture is worth a thousand words, and with Python‚Äôs matplotlib library, fortunately, takes far less than a thousand words of code to create a production-quality graphic.

## Seaborn‰∑Ä
Seaborn library is one of the rarest earth metals. If you are a science student you will get...üòÑ. Seaborn, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has interesting default themes.
Great Right!üò≤
 
 # Step 1.Plotting Scatter PLot
 
 *First we need to import two libraries namely seaborn and matplotlib to repl for that we just need need to type below commond in main.py file
 we have used two shortcuts sns represents seaborn and plt represents matplotlib*
```python 

        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib. pyplot as plt
```
 *We know that for plotting graph we need to add data .we will store them in list array by simply adding variable **height** and **weight** to store the any
 random values to be plotted.*
```python
        height = [62, 64, 69, 75, 66, 68, 65, 71, 76, 73]
        weight = [120, 136, 148, 175, 137, 165, 154, 172, 200, 187]
```
*Now we have to label the graph with graph type with what we put on **x** and **y** axis in graph. Here we will going to scatterplot as graph type and 
x label as height and y label as weight.*
```python
        sns.scatterplot(x=height, y=weight)
```
*Finally to show the graph we use this function*

```python
        plt.show()
```
        
 **Output**
 
 ![Scatter plot](https://cloud-ikhasazgz.vercel.app/3scatter_plot.png )
 
 ### Fantastic! You have created your first plot ###


# Step 2. Relp Plot

*This plot will need flights dataset so , if you already have downloaded and pasted in the reply folder. Then you don't need to do it twice. Otherwise i have already included datasets link here [flights](https://cloud-5jao3dtbu.vercel.app/0flights.csv "click to download")*

**Data-set required named [flights](https://cloud-5jao3dtbu.vercel.app/0flights.csv "click to download")
       
```python
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
```
*Here, we need one extra step because we are going download a **flights** data-sets. To download the dataset click highlighted flight word and put in your repl folder in which we are working and rename as* 
```python       
       flights = sns.load_dataset("flights")
```
*relp-plot  is one minimalist  plot i have discovered and i know you will like it too. Here we will be using relp graph plot, labelling as x axis as passengers,
labelling y axis as month, hue represents as color appearance parameters & last but not the least we need to load the data-set for that we have used  data = flights.*
```python
       sns.relplot(x="passengers", y="month", hue="year", data=flights)
```       
```python     
       plt.show() 
```
 ### Fantastic! You have created your relp plot ###
        
 **Output**
 
 ![Relp plot](https://cloud-ikhasazgz.vercel.app/2relp_plot.png)
 

# Step 3. Violin Plot


**Data-set required named [tips](https://cloud-1oaqj43if.vercel.app/0tips.csv "click to download")


*Here, we need two libraries namely matplotlib and seaborn  and then we have to loading tips" data set in tips variable(you can load datasets in any variable but make sure you use rename them each places too.
We are going to plot catplot, labelling the axis, kind is the parameter which is for which kind of graph plot and tips used to load the datasets*
```python        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        
        tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

        sns.catplot(x="day", y="total_bill", kind="violin", data=tips)
    
        plt.show()
 ```

**Output**

![Violen plot](https://cloud-ikhasazgz.vercel.app/4violin_plot.png)


 ### Fantastic! You have created your violin plot ###
        
        
# Step 4. Pair Grid

**Data-set required [flights](https://cloud-5jao3dtbu.vercel.app/0flights.csv "click to download")

*Here we have used plot type **PairGrid** which is one of it's kind to compare the plotted graph between the different varibles of the same dataset. which i do like it and here we will use them visualize as scatter. First we have loaded the dataset in **a** variable and **b** variable as plot type and finally we have use **map** the scatter visual on pair-grid plot


```python     
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        from scipy import stats
        
        a = sns.load_dataset("flights")

        b = sns.PairGrid(a)
        
        b.map(plt.scatter)
        
        plt.show()
```
        
       
**Output**

![Pair Grid](https://cloud-ikhasazgz.vercel.app/1pairgrid.png)

 ### I knew it you can do it! You have created your Pair grid plot ###

# Step 5. Heat Map

**Data-set required [flights](https://cloud-5jao3dtbu.vercel.app/0flights.csv "click to download")

*Plotting the heatmap one of the most amazing feeling i had and you can have it too!. First we have to import the libaries namely numpy, matplotlib & seaborn.
second we need to load the datasets in a variable **flights**. Third variable we have used ax for how we want to plot the axes. We have some parameters like annot, fmt, linewidth and cmap. Last but not the least you can see the plot by using ``plt.show()```.

 
 
```python
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns

        flights = sns.load_dataset("flights")
```        
*pivot is used so we can handle duplicate values for one index/column pair
```python
        flights = flights.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
```        
annot: the value will show on each cell of the heatmap
# fmt: adding annotations.
# linewidth: width between each box
# cmap: cmap is a color template that we have used.
```python
        ax = sns.heatmap(flights, annot=True, fmt="d", linewidths=5, cmap="YlGnBu")
```
        
 **Output**

 ![flight heatmap](https://cloud-tgw4nss32.vercel.app/0heatmap_2.png)


```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

flights = sns.load_dataset("flights")
flights = flights.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
corr = np.corrcoef(np.random.randn(10, 200))
mask = np.zeros_like(corr)
mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True
with sns.axes_style("white"):
    f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 5))
    ax = sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, vmax=.3, square=True)
plt.show()
```

  **Data-set required named** [flights](https://cloud-5jao3dtbu.vercel.app/0flights.csv "click to download")


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

flights = sns.load_dataset("flights")
flights = flights.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
grid_kws = {"height_ratios": (.9, .05), "hspace": .3}
f, (ax, cbar_ax) = plt.subplots(2, gridspec_kw=grid_kws)
ax = sns.heatmap(flights, ax=ax,
                 cbar_ax=cbar_ax,
                 cbar_kws={"orientation": "horizontal"})
plt.show()
```
